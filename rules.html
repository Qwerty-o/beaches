        <p class="text">While beaches may be all about relaxation and freedom, that is not necessarily the case when it comes to California’s beloved beaches. Because of many impacting factors, ocean warming, acidification, and sea level rise are threatening the health of California’s beaches.  Here are some important rules to keep in mind when visiting a California beach.
<ul>
    <ol>
        <li>No Smoking!</li>
        <p>Smoking is banned on California beaches. These policies protect the environment by reducing litter, pollution from tobacco waste, and wildfires.</p>

    <li>No Littering of Glass Bottles or Objects!</li> 
        <p>Many cut their feet on glass, often from broken bottles in the sand. The glass can be dangerous and a hazard especially for wildlife. </p>
    <li>No Swimming (In certain areas)</li>
        <p>Because of dangerous water conditions, swimming can be off limits often due to rip currents, jetties, rough waves, or dangerous entities in the water.</p>
    
    <li>  No Fires!</li>  
        <p>California is already in a drought and fires can threaten devastating wildfires to occur due to lack of responsibility for popular bonfires. These can be snuffed out if set up.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
            <p class="text">These are some general beach laws enacted in California’s beaches, however, when visiting a beach, check out the rules specific for that beach, as they can vary based on what is permitted and/or available.
