            Our mission is to preserve and inform about the beaches of California. California is a vast state full of many beautiful beaches, but there are many that go unvisited and some that are danger because of dangerous touristry. <br><br> We are a non-profit organization with a goal of preservation and information. Any donations made to our website go to charities for beach cleaning and preservation.
